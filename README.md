Projects for my Portfolio

In this project I finished the final part in a three part project called Busy Bus. This was the project brief:

Project brief
The concept of public transit trackers isnâ€™t new but it does offer up a wealth of opportunities to work with imperfect data that is incredibly important to the users of a given app or service. Few things will make people run faster than discovering their bus is a mere 2 minutes away from the bus stop.

In this exercise you are tasked with helping create a mobile app called BusyBus, an application operated by the local city transit system that serves thousands of commuters in a large city near you.

Transit officials have identified a problem they would like to solve. Due to expansion, numerous bus routes have been recently added and many of those routes stop at the same bus stop. Riders want to know what the next arriving bus is and how much time they have to get to the bus stop. Simply rushing to the stop when you see a bus coming no longer works because it might not be the bus the rider is expecting.

Riders are currently complaining the most about the bus stop at Washington and State, which has seven bus lines serving the stop.

Here's my work, divided my section.
  Part One: UX Fundamentals.

    A) Surveys: Link:https://docs.google.com/forms/d/11tB_mX3lE2PrFgCL-DfT6OyKRllCP_lng6DSK6BZ9Qw/edit?usp=sharing

    B) Competitive Analysis: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1D-ug2KUaMas7pHoosrZLxS-3zwfOaqDBfu3wR6RPC10/edit?usp=sharing

    C) User Stories: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19S7Ji0Bpze_QK6aSTrOzibr1R_75TG6wwZR7CTH5n1I/edit?usp=sharing

    D) Paper Prototype: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Bobvxy9MVYGyIzDPMwmlbaTxwSkInSst/view?usp=sharing

    E) Digital Prototype which I tested on three users: https://marvelapp.com/6e2gjbb/screen/43215917


  Part Two: Visual Design.

    A) Create a digital, high fidelity mockup of one of the three screens I created. The mockup followed the human-interfaces guidelines for iOS: https://www.figma.com/file/on1B5hZhksJwKDknynzuzV/iOS-11-GUI-%E2%80%93-iPhone-8-by-Great-Simple-Studio-Screens-Copy?node-id=18177%3A0

  Part Three: Code.

    A) I recreate the visual design in code. Here's what my coded project looked like:
